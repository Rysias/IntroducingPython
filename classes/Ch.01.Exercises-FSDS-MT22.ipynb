    "In the book we talk about data as being measurements from the world. The measurements represent phenomena but are not the phenomena themselves. To this end, we think of social data science as a 'science of the operationalisation of the social world'. Below are several key concepts about the world that we can operationalise in a variety of ways. For each of the concepts think of: \n",
    "1. A way that you can measure this concept in a survey. Is there a scale that people have used? Has this been mentioned in an academic paper? \n",
    "2. A question that you can ask someone in order to get a more indepth response about the topic.\n",
    "3. A set of data from a social media platform that might strongly predict with the measure, either directly or indirectly. Do you think that you could collect this data just by browsing or would you need to access this data in a more structured form?\n",

The most sophisticated NLP packages might know which `\"y\"` is a vowel. Do we need to go that far? Can we warn people or somehow use a parameter for an option to include or exclude `\"y\"`?"
